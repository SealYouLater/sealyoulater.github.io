              "Spencer is a hockey fanatic and a student of the game. Never played higher than house league, but not wanting to separate from the game, Spencer found a new love interest in the sport from behind the bench. 
              Over a decade later Spencer finds success as a coach. Having won multiple championships, awarded team and individual awards, and promoting and developing players to higher levels, it has made for an electric and joyful job.
              Nowadays Spencer enjoys coaching at the Junior hockey level (having done so in British Columbia and Ontario), and continues to pursue his dream becoming a reality and making it as a pro one day.
              Aside from coaching, this New York Giants and Oakland Athletics fan enjoys scouting players and attending hockey games (regularly found in a rink), hanging out with his friends and family,
              being the cinephile that he is and watching movies more than anyone else does, and walking his dog Fezzik."

             Born and raised in Ottawa, Stef is a life long Sens fan. He is committed to never paying to attend another Sens game as long as Eugene is the owner of his beloved team.
             He is also a road hockey legend who was on the receiving end of a triple Ovechtrick... as the goalie.

              He's cute, and he made this website. In my opinion: the most excellent
              of the bunch. He'll be around whenever something outrageous needs to be said or to spew his
              opinions like a Dilophosaurus spraying acid at Newman.

            The tech handy-man of the show; Tibet handles the sound engineering, the editing and video making. 
            Not much a die hard hockey fan but a lover of playoff hockey. Kinda roots for the Sens. he'll occasionally be brought on to be the neutral voice
            and the litmus test for moves around the NHL.
